PriconeTL is an unofficial English UI patch for [Cygames' Princess Connect Re:Dive JP](https://dmg.priconne-redive.jp/). The main focus of project is translating game's user interface into English so non-Japanese people can play it easier. Any help and contribute is welcome!

It is recommended to delete the old patch files instead of just replacing them
Delete the old `BepInEx` folder then extract zip files again.

## ![Maho](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/princess-connect/images/a/a7/Maho_Box_Icon.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/40?cb=20190925080932) UNINSTALLATION

Simply delete patch files which were extracted to `priconner` folder
There are no Priconne files that modified or damaged while installing this patch so you can simply delete them manually. Your game will turn it back to a vanilla state.

Files that must delete for uninstalling were:
```
BepInEx
changelog.txt
doorstop_config.ini
winhttp.dll
```

Vanilla state of priconner folder was like the below picture:

PriconeTL uses [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) as framework and uses [bbepis/XUnity.AutoTranslator](https://github.com/bbepis/XUnity.AutoTranslator) plugin to translate text. Configurations of both are available too!
- [BepInEx Config](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/configuration.html)
- [AutoTranslator Config](https://github.com/bbepis/XUnity.AutoTranslator#configuration)

PriconeTL also included [FineBrewDev/BepInEx.FullScreenizer](https://github.com/FineBrewDev/BepInEx.FullScreenizer). You can press F4 to toggle fullscreen
